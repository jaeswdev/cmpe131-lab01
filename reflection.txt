Branching allows us to be able to work on a specific feature or experiment in a safe environment without affecting the stable version of the project. It enables a team to work on multiple different features at the same time without interfering with each other’s work immediately.
It’s because our changes are isolated, it doesn’t break the main branch. Furthermore, it prevents unfinished work from getting mixed into the final product.
